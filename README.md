# Lab Project 1: Building a Tokenizer

## Introduction ヾ(⌐□_□)ノ♪
Welcome, weary traveller. My objective for the first lab project is to build a tokenizer that
maintains a history. Tokenizing is the process of dividing a string into
tokens by some delimeter (e.g. the string librarys split() function).
Consider tokenizing the string “The cake is a lie!” using the space
character. This would result in: \[“The”, “cake”, “is”, “a”, “lie!”\]. This lab isn't much, but it's honest work.

### Compiling & Running the Code
To compile & execute the user interface program, open the command prompt and enter
```sh
cd tokenizer-GigaMatt-1\
sudo make
./tokenizer.o
```

### Dependencies
1. The SystemsVM virtual machine provided by UTEP CS 3432 OR<br />
2. A Linux-based virtual machine.<br />

### Contributions
1. Daniel Cervantes (pointing me to use fgets() for user input) & booleans in C are integer 0s/1s.<br />
2. Wan Koo for teaching me the differences between <.h> & ".h" imports.<br />

### Warnings
1. Although the dependencies call for the use of a virual machine, you may use a local Linux OS to compile & execute this code. **WARNING** This should be reserved for advanced users.
